# Summary

The science department at our school did not like the test tube racks they were using. They found them cumbersome and annoying to use, so we created this new design.

The parts of the test tube rack are printed separately, and they are all detachable. If one of the drying rods snaps, you can either remove it and replace it, or you can print a drying rod sleeve and fit it snugly over the broken stub of the drying rod.

Two test tube racks can be stored compactly by interlocking them within each other. The drying rods on both test tube racks can be inserted simultaneously into the other rack's holding rack (the top piece with six large holes), making two test tube racks take roughly the same amount of space as one. 

PARTS:
1 Test Tube Rack Bottom Piece
1 Test Tube Rack Top Piece
6 Test Tube Rack Drying Rods
However many Drying Rod Sleeves are needed

# Print Settings

Printer: Dremel Idea Builder
Rafts: Yes

# Post-Printing

Sanding is sometimes needed if the raft is difficult to remove.
